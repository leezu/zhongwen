Translate Chinese characters and words by simply hovering over them with the mouse.

- Supports both traditional and simplified characters.
- Includes a recent version of the widely used CEDICT Chinese English dictionary.
- Displays Hanyu Pinyin along both the simplified and traditional characters.
- Uses a large font size for the Chinese characters to help learners clearly identify
  and memorize the different characters, especially those with a large number of strokes.
  Can also be used as a magnifier for small Chinese characters.
- As a learning aid it uses different colors for displaying the Pinyin syllables,
  depending on the tone of the Chinese character. The color scheme is the same
  as the one used by Skritter.
- Can be turned on and off with a single mouse-click.
- Highlights the characters whose translation is displayed in the popup window.
- Also supports keyboard navigation for translating the next character, the next word, or the
  previous character.
- Supports exporting words to the Skritter vocabulary queue.
